# Building Widgets as a Team

These are the slides and code of a talk I gave at [Bloom Technologies' Flutter Holland meetup](https://www.meetup.com/flutter-holland/events/297943457/).

## Abstract

So, you and your company have decided to use Flutter for your next project. Maybe you've already been using Flutter for a while, but you're looking to improve your workflow. You've heard about the benefits of using a common UI library and Figma designs, but aren't sure what this means. CI/CD and testing are also on your mind, but you're not sure how to get started. And why is everyone talking about state management all the time?

This talk will cover various topics that give you and your team the knowledge and tools you need to increase your productivity and build better apps. We'll talk about how to build packages and reusable components, how designers can best deliver their work to developers, how to set up CI/CD and testing pipelines, and how to choose the right state management solution for your project.
