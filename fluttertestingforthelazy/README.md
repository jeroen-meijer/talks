# Testing in Flutter and Dart (for the lazy)

These are the slides and code of talk I gave at [droidcon London 2021](<https://www.london.droidcon.com/program/testing-in-flutter-and-dart-(for-the-lazy)>).

## Abstract

You might be an avid tester who knows all the ins and outs of doing proper testing, and can bathe in buzzwords like code coverage, test-driven-development and continuous integration. Or, on the other hand, you might be the kind of person who has automated the process of deleting the test folder every time you create a new Flutter project.

For the lazy amongst you â€” fear no more; come join VGV on a quick-fire introduction on how, what and why to test Flutter and Dart applications.
